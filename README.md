Links clients and freelancers to promote skill utilisation

The system will allow Clients to list the contracts they are offering. Freelancers, on the other hand, will indicate their skills during the registration process. Users will upload digital certificates to verify their claims of qualifications. The system will then use an algorithm to match the skills needed and the skills supplied by the freelancers. The most qualified freelancers will be notified of the contracts tah fit their skills.
